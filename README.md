                                            MARINE OBJECT RECOGNITION

INTRO:

​​This project focuses on developing the marine object recognition model to detect marine object in underwater environments. Model addresses these issues like feature extraction, efficient training and better performance.This project presents a approach to marine animal detection and recognition using traditional deep learning models in the context of underwater image analysis. The model is trained on a comprehensive dataset comprising diverse marine species to ensure good performance. The model performance is evaluated in terms of  accuracy, species classification and better efficiency.

Image recognition is a widely used technology in various applications, enabling the identification and classification of objects within images. However, achieving good accuracy recognition can be challenging due to some factors such as low lighting variations, occlusions. To address these challenges, deep learning-based models have become the preferred approach, with Mobile-Net being an efficient and effective solution for marine object recognition apart from other models.​

In this project, we propose a Mobile-Net based approach for marine object recognition, aiming to accurately identify marine objects and classify them by name. The model is trained and evaluated on different types of marine species datasets to ensure good performance across different image conditions.
